# Metaphysics

This is a "living" book exploring the author's big questions. I hope you will enjoy this journey of ponderings and meanderings.

## Writing Style

The writings are in 1st person as the intention is for the reader to immerse themself in the experience of careful reflection. Singular "they" will be preferred over gendered pronouns.

## Maintainence

To build this book with R:

```bookdown::render_book('./bookdown')```

To preview the book while working on it:

```bookdown::serve_book()```
